## Building a Highly Available Citrix NetScaler ADC Pair

High availability is a critical requirement for any production-grade load balancing infrastructure. A NetScaler HA deployment uses two appliances working as a synchronized pair to ensure continuous service delivery. One node operates as the primary, actively handling client connections and backend traffic, while the secondary node remains in a monitoring and standby role. In the event of a failure or service disruption on the primary node, the secondary node automatically takes over, maintaining uninterrupted application access.
